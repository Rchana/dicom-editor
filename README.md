# dicom-editor

This a simple GUI I am working on parallel to a GUI I am building for research at St. Michael's Hospital (SMH). It's purpose is for testing before I integrate functionality over to the SMH GUI, & development of this testing GUI will have functionality limited to:
- Opening .dcm files
- Saving .dcm file edits
- Editing .dcm files (rotation, brightness, contrast, etc.)
- DICOM metadata access
(Potentially more to come)
